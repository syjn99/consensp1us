# consensp1us

`consensp1us` is a Proof of Concept of integrating zkVM with the current Ethereum Consensus layer. It will leverage [lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) and [sp1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1).

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/getting-started/install.html)

## Running the Project

There are four main ways to run this project: build a program, execute a program, generate a core proof, and
generate an EVM-compatible proof.

### Build the Program

To build the program, run the following command:

```sh
cd program
cargo prove build
```

### Execute the Program

To run the program without generating a proof:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This will execute the program and display the output.

### Generate a Core Proof

To generate a core proof for your program:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --prove
```

### Retrieve the Verification Key

To retrieve your `programVKey` for your on-chain contract, run the following command:

```sh
cargo prove vkey --program fibonacci-program
```
